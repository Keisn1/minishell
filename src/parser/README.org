- Represents a single node in the AST.
- Contains the type of node, which could be a command, pipe, logical operation (AND, OR), or an error.
- Links to other nodes via the =upstream= and =downstream= pointers, facilitating the tree structure.
- Can have a varying number of children, indicated by =num_children=.

* Example Command structure
A command like
#+begin_src shell
(echo "hello" && wc -l < input.txt ) || (echo "World" | cat > output.txt)
#+end_src
could be illustrated as follows
#+begin_src
                       [|| (OR)]
               /                        \
         [&& (AND)]                    [PIPE]
          /     \                    /         \
       (CMD)     (CMD REDIR)   (CMD)        (REDIR)
       [echo]    [wc -l]        [echo]        [cat]
        |           |              |            |
Args: "hello"     input.txt       "World"    output.txt
